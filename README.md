#  Peer Tutoring

A work-in-progress app which allows students to ask questions about homework which anyone can answer.  A points system similar to the StackOverflow mechanic will act as incentive for students to help others: points are earned by getting upvotes from other users or by being marked as the "accepted answer" by the asker. Project began during the summer of 2017 and built upon during Spring semester of my freshman year at Duke University during ARTSVIS 140: Create, Innovate, Act.
